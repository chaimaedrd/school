1. Create the page "login.php" which asks the user to enter his login and password in a form.
We suppose to have two users : student (Login="etudiant",Password="ensah") and Admin (Login="Admin",Passw="AdminENSAH") :
2. The admin can access page1.php while the student can access page2.php.
3. If a given user requests page1 or page2 directly (without authentication), they will have to be redirected to the authentication page.
4. In both pages display a welcome message with the user's login (For example example: Hello Administrator ) and a link for logging out
